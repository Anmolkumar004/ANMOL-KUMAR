                    <h2>V-Type Engine</h2>
                    <p>A V‑type engine is an internal‑combustion engine whose cylinders are split into two banks set at
                        an angle (typically about 60–90 degrees) around a single crankshaft, forming a “V” shape. Key
                        advantages include a shorter overall length than an equivalent inline engine, the ability to
                        package more cylinders in a compact space, and (in some layouts) excellent smoothness and
                        balance such as the inherently well‑balanced V12.</p>
                    <h4>What it is</h4>
                    <p>In a V engine, two rows of cylinders share one crankshaft; the “included angle” between the banks
                        defines the V and varies widely by design and application. Common production angles cluster near
                        60–90 degrees because they package well and work with typical firing orders and crankshaft
                        designs.</p>

                <div>
                    <h2>Advantages</h2>
                    <ul class="advantages">
                        <li>Shorter length than an equivalent inline engine, which helps fit larger or more cylinders
                            where engine bay length is limited.</li>
                        <li>Allows higher cylinder counts (V6, V8, V12) in a compact package, supporting higher power
                            potential for performance and luxury vehicles as well as trucks and SUVs.</li>
                        <li>Certain V configurations offer very smooth operation; notably, a V12 has inherently
                            excellent primary and secondary balance for refined running.</li>
                        <li>Compared with a flat (boxer) engine, a V is narrower, which can aid packaging in
                            width‑constrained compartments even though it is typically taller.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Types​</h2>
                    <li>V2 (V‑twin): Widely used in motorcycles; the earliest automotive V‑twin dates back to 1889
                        Daimler applications<< /li>
                    <li>V3: Rare configuration occasionally seen in motorcycles and discussed in overview lists of V
                        layouts</li>
                    <li>V4: Uncommon; used in some bikes and marine outboards due to packaging needs.</li>
                    <li>V5: Very rare automotive layout; appears in configuration roundups but far less common than
                        V6/V8</li>
                    <li>V6: Most common modern car V engine; typical bank angles include 60°, 90°, or 120° depending on
                        design goals</li>
                    <li>V8: Very common in performance, luxury, trucks; often uses a 90° bank angle for even firing with
                        common crank designs.</li>
                    <li>V10: Less common; used in high‑performance road cars and some diesels, with notable adoption in
                        models like the Dodge Viper historically.​</li>
                    <li>V12: Premium/performance applications; commonly built at 60° and valued for smoothness and
                        refinement</li>
